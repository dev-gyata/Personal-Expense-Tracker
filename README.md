## Getting Started ðŸš€

You have first setup flutter on your machine by following the [official documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor you have to first create it's env file in the root directory of the project

- development: `.env.dev`
- staging: `.env.stg`
- production: `.env.prod`

The contents of the env file should look like this:

```sh
BASE_URL=https://personal-expense-tracker.myladder.africa
```

or check the `.env.example` file for the correct format

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
$ flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart --dart-define-from-file=.env.dev

# Staging
$ flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart --dart-define-from-file=.env.stg

# Production
$ flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart --dart-define-from-file=.env.stg
```

_\*Personal Expense Tracker works on iOS and Android

```sh
flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
